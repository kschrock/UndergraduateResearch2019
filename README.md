# UndergraduateResearch2019
Howdy! This past summer, I researched at Stanford University, specifically Human-Computer Interaction.
Over the summer, we were able to run a pilot study of 15 participants. Our creativity assessment consisted of
analyzing the participant's convergent and divergent thinking through Qualtrics during the study. Our study design
had a physio baseline measurement with three creativity assessments (Before, During, and After). We measured if creativity
was affected, whether being a passenger or driver in a car-simulator for 20 minutes. After capturing the data and analyzing it,
we found that for a driver, divergent thinking is increased (which is linked for creativity), and convergent went down (linked for literal thinking) thus,
proving our hypothesis.
